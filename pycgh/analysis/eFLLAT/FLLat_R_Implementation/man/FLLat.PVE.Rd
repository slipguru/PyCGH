\title{Function for Choosing the Number of Features for the Fused Lasso
  Latent Feature Model}

\description{Calculates the percentage of variation explained (PVE) for
  a range of values of \eqn{J} (the number of features) for the Fused
  Lasso Latent Feature (FLLat) model.  Also plots the PVE against J,
  which can be used for choosing the value of \eqn{J}.}

\usage{
FLLat.PVE(Y, J.seq=seq(1,min(15,floor(ncol(Y)/2)),by=2),
          B=c("pc","rand"), lams=c("same","diff"), thresh=10^(-4),
          maxiter=100, maxiter.B=1, maxiter.T=1)

\method{plot}{PVE}(x, xlab="Number of Features", ylab="PVE", \dots)
}

\arguments{
  \item{Y}{A matrix of data from an aCGH experiment (usually in the form
  of log intensity ratios) or some other type of copy number data.  Rows
  correspond to the probes and columns correspond to the samples.}
  \item{J.seq}{A vector of values of \eqn{J} (the number of features) for
  which to calculate the PVE.  The default values are every second
  integer between 1 and the minimum of 15 and the number of samples
  divided by 2.}
  \item{B}{The initial values for the features to use in the FLLat
  algorithm for each value of \eqn{J}.  Can be one of \code{"pc"} (the
  first \var{J} principal components of \code{Y}) or \code{"rand"} (a
  random selection of \eqn{J} columns of \code{Y}).  The default is
  \code{"pc"}.}
  \item{lams}{The choice of whether to use the same values of the tuning
  parameters in the FLLat algorithm for each \eqn{J} (\code{"same"}) or
  to calculate the optimal tuning parameters for each J (\code{"diff"}).
  When using the same values, the optimal tuning parameters are
  calculated once for the default value of \eqn{J} in the FLLat
  algorithm.  The default is \code{lams="same"}.}
  \item{thresh}{The threshold for determining when the solutions have
  converged in the FLLat algorithm.  The default is \eqn{10^{-4}}{10^(-4)}.}
  \item{maxiter}{The maximum number of outer iterations for the FLLat
  algorithm.  The default is 100.}
  \item{maxiter.B}{The maximum number of iterations for the inner loop
  of the FLLat algorithm for estimating the features \eqn{B}.  The default
  value is 1.  Increasing this may decrease the number of outer
  iterations but may still increase total run time.}
  \item{maxiter.T}{The maximum number of iterations for the inner loop
  of the FLLat algorithm for estimating the weights \eqn{\Theta}.  The default
  value is 1.  Increasing this may decrease the number of outer
  iterations but may still increase total run time.}
  \item{x}{An object of class \code{PVE}, as returned by
  \code{\link{FLLat.PVE}}.}
  \item{xlab}{The title for the x axis of the PVE plot.}
  \item{ylab}{The title for the y axis of the PVE plot.}
  \item{\dots}{Further graphical parameters.}

\details{
  This function calculates the percentage of variation explained (PVE)
  for each value of \eqn{J} as specified by \code{J.seq}.  The PVE is
  defined to be: \deqn{PVE = 1 - \frac{RSS}{TSS}}{PVE = 1 - RSS/TSS}
  where RSS and TSS denote the residual sum of squares and the total sum
  of squares, respectively.  The PVE is calculated by fitting the FLLat
  model for each value of \eqn{J}.

  There are two choices for how the tuning parameters are chosen when
  fitting the FLLat model for each value of \eqn{J}.  The first choice, given
  by \code{lams="same"}, applies the \code{\link{FLLat.BIC}} function
  just once for the default value of \eqn{J}.  The resulting optimal
  tuning parameters are used for all values of \eqn{J} in \code{J.seq}.
  The second choice, given by \code{lams="diff"}, applies the
  \code{\link{FLLat.BIC}} function for each value of \eqn{J} in
  \code{J.seq}.  Although this second choice will give a more accurate
  measure of the PVE, it will take much longer to run than the first
  choice.

  When the PVE is plotted against \eqn{J}, as \eqn{J} increases, after a
  certain point the PVE will begin to plateau, indicating that
  additional features are not improving the model.  Therefore, the value
  of \eqn{J} to use in the FLLat algorithm can be chosen as the point at
  which the PVE plot begins to plateau.
  
  For more details, please see Nowak and others (2011) and the package
  vignette.
